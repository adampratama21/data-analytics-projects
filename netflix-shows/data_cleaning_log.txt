Data Cleaning Log â€“ netflix_titles.csv

1. Fixed multi-line row issue:
   - Some movie titles spanned multiple lines due to improper quotation.
   - Manually merged split lines to restore correct record format in the CSV file.

2. Fixed misaligned columns due to missing commas:
   - Some rows had missing commas, causing values to shift into incorrect columns (e.g., 'duration' value placed under 'rating').
   - Manually reviewed and corrected affected rows to ensure proper alignment with column headers.

3. Removed duplicates:
   - Checked for duplicate rows based on all columns.
   - 0 rows removed.

4. Replaced missing values:
   - Columns affected: 'director', 'cast', 'country', 'rating', 'listed_in'.
   - Empty cells replaced with "Unknown" to maintain consistency.

5. Split multi-country values in Country column:
  - Method: Split by delimiter (comma), then unpivot columns into rows
  - Purpose: To ensure each country is counted accurately in visualizations

6. Fixed misplaced comma:
  - Removed or fixed comma placement on a few rows in the country column to ensure accurate splitting.
